Lingua-Lex

Lingua::Lex is a Perl module for the management of lexical information, especially
for use with the tokenizer of Lingua::Tok. Given a word as a string, Lingua::Lex
returns a token consisting of a type (generally the part of speech) and the word.

There are also some morphological mechanisms that allow a word to be identified
based on affixes and a root; if this is the case, the token reflects this. Similarly,
if the part of speech includes markers (plural, masculine, etc.), that's in the
token as well.
